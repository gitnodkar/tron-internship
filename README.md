# Tron Internship Mini‚ÄëProjects

During my first internship, I developed a series of GUI and game‚Äëlogic mini‚Äëprojects in Python and Kotlin to strengthen my desktop‚Äêapp and algorithmic skills. This single README describes each project, how to run it, and the key features.

## üïí 1. Digital Clock (Tkinter)

**File:** `digital_clock.py`  
**Description:** A simple digital clock GUI displaying current hours, minutes, and seconds, updating every second.  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Tkinter, `time` module  

**How to Run:**
1. Install Python and Tkinter.
2. Run the script: `python digital_clock.py`.

**Features:**
- Displays the current time in a digital format (HH:MM:SS).
- Updates every second using the `after` method.
